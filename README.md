# 2D-customized-PDK
An open-source customized Process Design Kit (PDK) for 2D-material-based devices and circuits. This repository provides parameterized models, compact device descriptions, physical verification files, parasitic extraction files, technology files and benchmark scripts tailored for 2D semiconductors, enabling designâ€“technology co-optimization (DTCO) and circuit prototyping with emerging 2D materials.
